## Welcome to the Algorithm Series: Graph Algorithms

After unraveling the intricacies of sorting algorithms, we would be diving into one of the most powerful and fundamental topics in computer science: Graph Algorithms.

From the social networks we scroll through to the GPS navigation we rely on, graph algorithms are the invisible engines powering the technology that defines our modern world. Let's explore how they work.

### What Is a Graph Algorithm?
Graph algorithms are a set of computational techniques used to solve problems related to graphs, which are data structures consisting of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). I understanding graph datastrutures kindly refer to (). Graph algorithms are used to help analyze and process graphs in areas like networking, social media, search engines, and more.
