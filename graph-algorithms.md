## Welcome to the Algorithm Series: Graph Algorithms

After unravelling all about sorting algorithms, this episode, we would conclude our series on Discovering JavaScript's Hidden Secrets. Let's dive into graph algorithms.

### What Is a Graph Algorithm?
Graph algorithms are a set of computational techniques used to solve problems related to graphs, which are data structures consisting of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). These algorithms help analyze and process graphs in areas like networking, social media, search engines, and more.

A graph consists of:

Vertices (Nodes): Represent entities (e.g., cities, people, computers, web pages).

Edges (Links): Represent relationships or connections between vertices (e.g., roads, friendships, network cables, hyperlinks).
