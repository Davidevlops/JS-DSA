## Welcome to the Algorithm Series: Graph Algorithms

After unraveling the intricacies of sorting algorithms, we now conclude our series, Discovering JavaScript's Hidden Secrets, by diving into one of the most powerful and fundamental topics in computer science: Graph Algorithms.

### What Is a Graph Algorithm?
Graph algorithms are a set of computational techniques used to solve problems related to graphs, which are data structures consisting of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). These algorithms help analyze and process graphs in areas like networking, social media, search engines, and more.

A graph consists of:

Vertices (Nodes): Represent entities (e.g., cities, people, computers, web pages).

Edges (Links): Represent relationships or connections between vertices (e.g., roads, friendships, network cables, hyperlinks).
