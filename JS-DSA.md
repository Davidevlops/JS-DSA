##### Prerequisites

In solving data structures and algorithms using JavaScript, you must be knowledgeable about JavaScript fundamentals which include Basic syntaxes, Variables, Data types, Control flows, Functions, and scope.

#### Big O notation

Big O notation is used to analyze and describe the efficiency or complexity of an algorithm. Big O notation discusses the runtime of an algorithm which grows as the input grows.
The notation is typically expressed as O(f(n)), where "f(n)" is a function that represents the growth rate of the algorithm's time or space complexity in relation to the input size "n." The "O" stands for "order of," and it provides an upper bound on the growth rate.

- o(1) This grows as the input grows it is not reflected.
- o(n) This shows the number of operations is bounded by a mutilple of n.
- o(n) This means a nested loop which means an operation inside an o(n) operation.

###### Simplifying Big O expressions

- o(2n) can be simplified to o(n)
- o(500) can be simplified to o(1)
- o(13n^2) can be simplified to o(n^2)
- o(n+10) can be simplified to o(n)
- o(1000n+50) can be simplified to o(n)
- o(n^2+5n+8) can be simplified to o(n^2)

###### Important things to take note of in Big O notation

- Arithmetic operations are constant time
- Variable assignment has a constant time
- Accessing element in an array by index or in an object by keys has a constant time
- In a loop, the complexity of an algorithm is the length of the loop multiplied by the complexity of whatever happens in the loop
