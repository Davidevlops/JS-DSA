Whether you're a seasoned developer seeking to enhance your proficiency or a newcomer eager to dive into the realm of data structures and algorithms, this content is tailored to provide clarity and practical insights. Join us on a journey that combines theoretical foundations with hands-on coding examples, empowering  you to build robust and efficient solutions in JavaScript.

#### Prerequisites
In solving data structures and algorithms using JavaScript, you must have an understanding of JavaScript basic syntaxes, Data types, variables, control flows, functions, and scope.

#### Big O notation
Big O notation discusses the runtime of an algorithm which grows as the input grows.
An algorithm is o(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n) as a increases.
o(1)- This grows as the input  grows it is not reflected.
o(n)- This shows the number of operations is bounded by a mutilple of n.
o(n^2) This means a nested loop which means an operation inside an o(n) operation.

Simplifying Big O expressions
* o(2n) can be simplified to o(n)
* o(500) can be simplified to o(1)
* o(13n^2) can be simplified to o(n^2)
* o(n+10) can be simplified to o(n)
* o(1000n+50) can be simplified to o(n)
* o(n^2+5n+8) can be simplified to o(n^2)
