Join us on a journey that combines theoretical foundations with hands-on coding examples, empowering you to build robust and efficient solutions in JavaScript.

##### Prerequisites

In solving data structures and algorithms using JavaScript, you must be knowledgeable about JavaScript fundamentals which include Basic syntaxes, Variables, Data types, Control flows, Functions, and scope.

#### Big O notation

Big O notation discusses the runtime of an algorithm which grows as the input grows.
An algorithm is o(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n) as a increases.

- o(1) This grows as the input grows it is not reflected.
- o(n) This shows the number of operations is bounded by a mutilple of n.
- o(n) This means a nested loop which means an operation inside an o(n) operation.

###### Simplifying Big O expressions

- o(2n) can be simplified to o(n)
- o(500) can be simplified to o(1)
- o(13n^2) can be simplified to o(n^2)
- o(n+10) can be simplified to o(n)
- o(1000n+50) can be simplified to o(n)
- o(n^2+5n+8) can be simplified to o(n^2)

###### Important things to take note of in Big O notation

- Arithmetic operations are constant time
- Variable assignment has a constant time
- Accessing element in an array by index or in an object by keys has a constant time
- In a loop, the complexity of an algorithm is the length of the loop multiplied by the complexity of whatever happens in the loop
