Welcome back to another section of data structures and algorithms. since we have dicussued all the comon data structure. In this series, we'll explore algorithms, discussing the common types of algorithm and further justifying the difference between algorithms and coding patterns.

We'll emabk on what algorithms are really are. 
- **Algorithm:** let's start by tracing the etymological meaning of how the world algorithm came to play. The word algorithm comes from the name of a 9th-century Persian mathematician, Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī. He wrote a book in Arabic on arithmetic and algebra, titled Kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī (Book on Calculation with Hindu Numerals) which introduced systematic methods for solving linear and quadratic equations. His name was Latinized as "Algoritmi" in European texts, and his computational methods became known as algorismus.

Algorithm referred to step-by-step procedures for arithmetic calculationsa. In the 20th century, it expanded to mean any systematic computational procedure, especially in computer science. Algorithms are written for specific purposes. We would explore the common algorithms available.
