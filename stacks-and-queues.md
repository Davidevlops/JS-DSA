Welcome to the last episode on linear data structures. In the last episode, we discussed linked list as a type of data structure and also explained the two main types of linked list. Also, we implemented a typical singly and doubly linkedlist with their various operations.

In this episode, we'll be discussing stacks and queues as types of linear data structures. Let's dive in.

Think of a stack as a collection of items stacked on top of each other, similar to a stack of plates in a cafeteria. The last plate placed on the stack is the first one to be removed.
