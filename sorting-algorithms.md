### Welcome to the Algorithm Series

Welcome back to another section of *Discovering JavaScript's Hidden Secrets*. Having dicusssed searching algorithms, we now begin our exploration of **sorting algorithms**—a core part of solving data-related problems in programming.

This part of the series dives into **searching algorithms**—what they are, why they matter, and how two fundamental types (Linear and Binary Search) work in practice.

### What Is a Sorting Algorithm?

A **searching algorithm** is a step-by-step method used to locate a specific element within a collection of data—such as an array, list, tree, graph, or database. The primary goal is to determine whether the target element exists in the dataset and, if it does, return its position or relevant information.

### Why Are Searching Algorithms Important?

Searching algorithms are essential in both everyday computing and advanced software systems. They play a major role in:

1. **Databases**: Quickly locating records using queries and indexing.
2. **AI & Machine Learning**: Efficiently accessing and retrieving relevant data from vast datasets.
3. **Networking**: Searching through routing tables, IP addresses, and DNS entries.
4. **User Interfaces**: Powering features like file searches, autocomplete suggestions, and command filters.

### Types of Searching Algorithms

There are several searching algorithms used in computer science, including:

* **Linear Search**
* **Binary Search**
* **Hash-Based Search**
* **Tree-Based Search**
* **Advanced Methods** (e.g., Interpolation Search, Exponential Search)

In this series, we will focus on two foundational algorithms: **Linear Search** and **Binary Search**.

### Linear Search

**Linear Search** (or sequential search) is the simplest search algorithm. It checks each element in a list or array one-by-one until the target value is found or the list ends.

* **Time Complexity**: O(n)
* **Design Technique**: Brute Force
* **Use Case**: Works on unsorted data

**Example:**

```javascript
function linearSearch(arr, target) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === target) {
            return i; // Return index if found
        }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if not found
}

// Example usage
const numbers = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6];
const targetNumber = 9;

const result = linearSearch(numbers, targetNumber);

if (result !== -1) {
    console.log(`Element found at index ${result}`);
} else {
    console.log("Element not found in the array");
}
```

### Binary Search

**Binary Search** is an efficient algorithm that works only on **sorted arrays**. It repeatedly divides the search range in half, comparing the target value to the middle element.

* **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
* **Design Technique**: Divide and Conquer
* **Use Case**: Requires sorted data

**Example:**

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // Target not found
}

// Example usage
const sortedNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13];
console.log(binarySearch(sortedNumbers, 9)); // Output: 4
console.log(binarySearch(sortedNumbers, 2)); // Output: -1
```
