### Welcome to the Algorithm Series

Welcome back to another section of *Discovering JavaScript's Hidden Secrets*. Having dicusssed searching algorithms, we now begin our exploration of **sorting algorithms**—a core part of solving data-related problems in programming.

This part of the series dives into **searching algorithms**—what they are, why they matter, and how two fundamental types (Linear and Binary Search) work in practice.

### What Is a Sorting Algorithm?

 A **sorting algorithms** Sorting algorithms is a step-by-step procedure designed to arrange a collection of data (such as an array or list) in a specific order—most commonly in ascending or descending order. They are fundamental in computer science because sorted data enables faster searching, efficient data retrieval, and optimized operations in databases and real-world applications.

### Why Are Sorting Algorithms Important?

Sorting algorithms are essential in both everyday computing and advanced software systems. They play a major role in:

1. **Faster Search & Retrieval**: Binary Search: Requires sorted data to achieve O(log n) search time (vs. O(n) for linear search). Databases: Indexing (e.g., B-trees) relies on sorted keys for quick record retrieval. Sorted lists enable fast prefix matching (e.g., Google suggestions).
2. **Efficient Data Processing**: Sorting helps in aggregation, joining datasets (like SQL ORDER BY), and trend analysis.
3. **Improved User Experience**: In E-commerce Products sorted by price, rating, or popularity (Amazon, eBay). In Music/Video Streaming Recommendations sorted by user preference (Spotify, Netflix).

4. **Optimized Storage & Memory**: Database Optimization works efficiently with sorted data which allows for efficient compression (run-length encoding).

### Types of Sorting Algorithms

There are several searching algorithms used in computer science, including:

* **Bubble Sort**
* **Insertion Sort**
* **QuickSort**
* **Merge Sort**
* **Heap Sort** 
* **Radix Sort**

### Bubble Sort

**Bubble Sort** Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list (beginning of the array) while larger elements "sink" to the bottom (end of the array) with each iteration.
* **Time Complexity**:  O(n²)
* **Design Technique**: Brute Force
* **Use Case**: Works on sorted data

**Example:**

function bubbleSort(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let swapped;
    
    // Outer loop for passes
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        swapped = false;
        
        // Inner loop for comparisons
        // The last i elements are already in place
        for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            // Compare adjacent elements
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // Swap if they are in the wrong order
                [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        
        // If no swaps occurred in the inner loop, the array is sorted
        if (!swapped) break;
    }
    
    return arr;
}

// Example usage
const unsortedArray = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
console.log("Unsorted array:", unsortedArray);
const sortedArray = bubbleSort(unsortedArray);
console.log("Sorted array:", sortedArray);

### Binary Search

**Binary Search** is an efficient algorithm that works only on **sorted arrays**. It repeatedly divides the search range in half, comparing the target value to the middle element.

* **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
* **Design Technique**: Divide and Conquer
* **Use Case**: Requires sorted data

**Example:**

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // Target not found
}

// Example usage
const sortedNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13];
console.log(binarySearch(sortedNumbers, 9)); // Output: 4
console.log(binarySearch(sortedNumbers, 2)); // Output: -1
```
