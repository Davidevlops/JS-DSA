Welcome to another entire section under datas structures which is non-linear data. In the previous episode, we explored stacks and queues as a type of linear data structure. Additionally, we implemented typical operations for both data structure and that brought to end of linear data structure.

In this episode, we'll be exploring grpahs, which is a fundamental non-linear data structures used in computer science. Let's dive in.

- **Graphs:** A graph as a type of non-linear data structure is a collection of nodes also referred to as vertices and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are fundamental concept in computer science and is used to represent relationships between objects. In discussing graphs, it's important we understand we understand some important concepts which include: Nodes and Edges

- **Nodes:** Nodes are also referred to as vertices. Nodes are entities in a graph which could represent any discrete object, such as cities in a map, users in a social network, or web pages in a hyperlink network.

- **Edges:** Edges are connections between pairs of nodes. They represent relationships or interactions between the nodes they connect. Edges can be directed or undirected

- **Directed Edge:** An edge where the relationship between nodes has a specific direction. For example, in a network of web pages, a hyperlink from one page to another would be represented by a directed edge, indicating the direction of the link.

- **Undirected Edge:** An edge where the relationship between nodes is bidirectional, meaning it doesn't have a specific direction. For example, in a social network graph, a friendship between two users would be represented by an undirected edge.

### Conclusion

In this episode, we have comprehensively discussed stacks and queues as a type of linear data structure in JavaScript. We implemented a detailed example demonstrating how to create and manipulate them, covering various operations. In the next episode, we'll explore graphs as a type of non-linear data structure.
