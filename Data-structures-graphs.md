Welcome to another section on data structures, this time, we would be focusing on non-linear data structures. In the previous section, we delved into stacks and queues, which are examples of linear data structures. Now, we'll explore non-linear structures, which exhibit more complex relationships between their elements. Let's begin by understanding the fundamental concepts and operations associated with non-linear data structures

In this section, we'll delve into graphs, a fundamental non-linear data structure widely used in computer science. Graphs offer a versatile way to represent relationships between objects or entities. Let's dive in and explore the concepts, properties, and operations associated with graphs.

- **Graphs:** A graph, as a type of non-linear data structure, consists of a collection of nodes, also known as vertices, and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are a fundamental concept in computer science and are utilized to represent various relationships between objects. As we delve into the topic of graphs, it's essential to grasp some key concepts, namely: Nodes and Edges.

- **Nodes:** Nodes are also referred to as vertices. Nodes are entities in a graph which could represent any discrete object, such as cities in a map, users in a social network, or web pages in a hyperlink network.

- **Edges:** Edges are connections between pairs of nodes. They represent relationships or interactions between the nodes they connect. Edges can be directed or undirected

  In discussing graphs, it's important to note that there are different types of graphs which include:Directed Graph, Undirected Graph, Weighted Graph, Unweighted Graph, Cyclic Graph and Acyclic Graph

### Conclusion

In this episode, we have comprehensively discussed stacks and queues as a type of linear data structure in JavaScript. We implemented a detailed example demonstrating how to create and manipulate them, covering various operations. In the next episode, we'll explore graphs as a type of non-linear data structure.
